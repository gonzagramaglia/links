## Hey, I'm **[gonza](https://www.gonza.uno/)**
It's good to see that you have been interested in understanding this repository.<br><br>



I want to thank Lee Robinson ([leerob.io](https://leerob.io/)) 
who was my guide in the development adventure of this project, 
during the **[Building a Linktree Clone! (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFzNekhVhmM)** tutorial ðŸ‘Œ<br><br><br>



ðŸ“Œ **LIVE DEMO [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]: _https://links.gonza.uno/_**

#### Links folder
Create project folder, open it in VSCode and open terminal

#### Structure initialization:
```bash
npx create-next-app --tailwind . 
```
(By using the period (.) after the command, you tell Next.js to create the project in the current folder instead of creating a new folder with the name of the project)
