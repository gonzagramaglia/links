## Hey, I'm **[Gonza](https://gonza.gr/)**
It's good to see that you have been interested in understanding this repository.<br><br>



I want to thank Lee Robinson ([leerob.io](https://leerob.io/)) 
who was my guide in the development adventure of this project, 
during the **[Building a Linktree Clone! (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFzNekhVhmM)** tutorial 👌

Also thanks to WebDev SHORTS for [this incredible video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aywzn9cf-_U) that helped me 
achieve the magnificent starry background ✨
